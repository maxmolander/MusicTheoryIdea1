Holding, repeating, arpeggiating, etc with 8 note chords

This is an exercise to learn about python audio programming, possibly to inform more elaborate future dsp-type projects

Given a bpm (beats per minute) and number of beats per chord, the goal is to:

build 8-note chords based off of:
  Note names (A, Bb, C#...) and 
  Chord quality (Major, minor7...)

"perform" and sequence multiple chords in different ways such as 
  holding a chord, 
  playing it on and off, 
  arpeggiating through the individual notes
