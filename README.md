# MusicTheoryIdea1
Holding, repeating, arpeggiating, etc with 8 note chords

This is an exercise to learn about python audio programming to inform more elaborate music theory decision-making and dsp-type projects

Given a bpm (beats per minute) and number of beats per chord, this project should:

build 8-note triad and seventh chords based off of:
  Note names (A, Bb, C#...) and 
  Chord quality (Major, minor7...)

"perform" and sequence multiple chords in different ways such as 
  holding a chord, 
  playing it on and off, 
  arpeggiating up through the notes,
  or a combination
